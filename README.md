# Colour Matcher
 WordPress plugin developed for a client for sorting and displaying a large list of colours as part of a product catalogue.

 Since there were so many entries, they could not be stored in the Wordpress database. Instead, a custom solution involving writing and reading to a JSON file was developed.
 
 Plugin supports dynamically adding and deleting entires, as well as mass import from CSV.
